# ASCIImon
Pokemon in ASCII 

With Pokemon Go coming out, I decided to make a Pokemon-like game (eg the handheld games such as Pokemon Ruby) using C++, as well as using SFML for music and sound effects.

It starts off like a regular pokemon game, talking to a "Pokemon Prof." (But a "Asciimon Prof") and then you just get thrown into a world where you can walk around and encouner Asciimon.
