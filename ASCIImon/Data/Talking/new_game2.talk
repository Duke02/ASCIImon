$var name

So, your name is $name? Nice.
I been studying Asciimon for 49 years now.
I am getting old, far too old to complete my research.
$name, I need you go to adventure out there.
You must capture every Asciimon in this region for me.
Oh! But first, you must make a choice.
In order to capture Asciimon, you need one.
These are very rare ones.
I trust you will keep care of one of them.
Which one would you like?
